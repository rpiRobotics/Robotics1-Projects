Fall 2017
----
All fall 2017 project files should be placed in this folder with one folder per team. 

Your folder name may be anything distinguishing your team (either your assigned team number or a chosen project name).
Your team folder should also include a README.md or README.txt (a simple text file) that has the following elements:
* your team / project name
* list your team members
* briefly describe the contents of your folder and how to run your code (if it needs any special instructions)
